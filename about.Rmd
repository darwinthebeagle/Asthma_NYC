# Overview

# Introduction

Asthma is a major public health concern both in New York City and nationally across the United States. According to CDC's Behaviorial Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data in 2012, approximately 1.4 million New York adults and 314,000 children (under the age of 18) reported having asthma. While data has shown that in the last 10 years, annual asthma related deaths have decreased significantly by over 20%, the disparities in air quality and asthma rates across neighborhoods should be addressed. 

The objective of our project is to further understand the air quality across the different neighborhoods in New York City, through looking at different pollutants and their levels. In addition, we hope to explore the relationship between air quality, poverty, and asthma-related health outcomes.    

# Data Source

The data was obtained from the [NYC Environment & Health Data Portal](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/PublicTracking.aspx) and the [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r/data). 

The New York City neighborhood boundaries were defined by the [United Hospital Fund Neighorhood Index](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTPDF/uhf42.pdf). There are a total of 42 neighorboods across the 5 boroughsâ€”Bronx, Staten Island, Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn.    

From the air quality data, we focused on 5 outdoor air quality pollutants:

- Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
- Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
- Benzene
- Formaldehyde
- Nitrogen Oxide (NOx)

In addition to outdoor air pollutants, we wanted to explore the indoor exposure to mold that may contribute to the prevalence of asthma. Data collected from the New York City Community Health Survey of the percentage of adults reporting mold in their homes were used. The percentages were collected and calculated based off the number of adults reporting damp spots or mold in at least one room in their building, excluding the bathroom, in the past 30 days. 

The 3 health outcomes of interest are asthma-related ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for adults and for children (under the age of 18).

# Analyses
Research questions that we were interested in exploring in our analyses: 

1) What is the distribution of asthma rates across neighborhoods?
2) What is the relationship between pollution levels and the poverty level of the neighborhood? 
3) How do the rates of asthma-related ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths between different neighborhoods compare? Are there any indication of disparities?
4)
