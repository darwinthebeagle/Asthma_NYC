669,Total Cancer in Children,Age Adusted Rate Less Than 15 Yrs Old,Age-specific number of resident children aged less than 15 years diagnosed with cancer over 5 year period, divided by the corresponding age-specific intercensal population estimates (from NYS DOH). The resulting age-specific rates are multiplied by the proportion of the US Census 2000 standard population in each age group. Age-adjusted rate is the sum of these weighted rates; expressed as cases per 1,000,000 residents.,NYS CR,New York State Cancer Registry

673,Test1,Number of days,<p>Walkability indices summarize built environment features believed to promote walking, focusing on neighborhood infrastructure. Some potentially important characteristics are usually not included, such as neighborhood safety or attractiveness, like number of street trees.</p><p> For this index, higher scores indicate greater walkability. NYC neighborhoods range in walkability index (infrastructure) score from -4.0 to 9.4, with zero representing an approximate average for the City as a whole. </p><p> Z-scores were calculated and summed across indicators of residential population density (density of population per total residential land area); intersection density; an entropy measure of land use based on the distribution of building floor area among 5 land-use types (education, entertainment, residential (single- and multi-family), retail, and office); the ratio of retail building floor area to retail land area; and subway stop density. This scale is a variation of Frank's Walkability Index. <p><b><a href="EPHTPDF/Walkability.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a></b> for a full description of the Walkability Index (Infrastructure). </p></p><p>For more information, visit <a href="http://beh.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">http://beh.columbia.edu/</a>.</p>,NWS,National Weather Service
